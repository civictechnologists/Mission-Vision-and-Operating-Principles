# This is a historical document used as a starting point for our own values exersise 

In 2017, the Brigades came togethe3r at Brigade Congress and drafted a Mission/Vision/Operating Principles document for review. Since that time, CfA has taken the finalized document from their website. However, this document is useful for a starting point for ACT as it was the last time the network came together to decide values. This is something we intend to update during our co-creation process.
